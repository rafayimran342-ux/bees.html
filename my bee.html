                                Bees are famous for the "waggle dance," a complex series of movements used to tell hive-mates exactly where flowers are located. This dance communicates the distance and direction of a food source relative to the sun. Even more impressive? They understand the concept of zero, a cognitive feat once thought to be exclusive to humans and primates

                                        These are the males. Their only job is to mate with a queen. Fun (or sad) fact: once they mate, they die. If they don't mate by winter, the workers kick them out of the hive to save food.<div>These are all females. They do everything: forage for nectar, protect the hive, clean, and nurse the larvae.</div>

                                            To produce just 450 grams (1 lb) of honey, a colony of bees must visit roughly 2 million flowers and fly over 88,000 kilometers (55,000 miles).
